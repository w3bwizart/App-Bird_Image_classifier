# Bird Image classifier
This app is a converted Jupyter notebook into a Flask app from the Fast.AI course: Practical Deep Learning for coders. [https://course.fast.ai/](https://course.fast.ai/)

## Notebook steps
- The notebook pulls images from the web; birds, forests.
- Create a model
- Train the model
- Validate the model 

## Added feature
- I added a UI with Flask to upload an images and let the model classify and provide a probability.
